#The task: distinguish meaningful text from nonsense.
The text written by real people looks like this: "I can create, I can create! I have two disadvantages: a bad memory and something else. No one knows as much as I do."
The nonsense looks like this: ajfhgoowowo aijfijafjioafoji anjfjnfjjjoa fhfdhds. My goal is to develop a machine learning algorithm that would distinguish one from the other. For convenience, I will call meaningful text "clean" and nonsense - "harmful". A similar task is actually solved when analyzing real files in a real antivirus system. For a person, the task seems obvious, because it is immediately clear where the text is clean and where it is harmful, but formalizing the difference, or even more so explaining it to a computer, is much more difficult. Machine learning is used here: first you need to give the system samples. He will "learn" from them, and then he himself will answer correctly where exactly.
